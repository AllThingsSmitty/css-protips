  * Indent with two spaces
  * Use shorthand, e.g., `margin: 10px 10px 5px;`
  * Use double quotes, e.g., `background: url("logo.svg");`
  * Sort properties alphabetically
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The PR should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!
